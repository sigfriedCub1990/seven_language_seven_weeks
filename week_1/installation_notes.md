# Installation notes

To execute the programs in the book it's safe to use the latest version of Ruby, 3.2.0 as of this writing. My preferred installation method is through [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf), after installing `asdf` do:

```bash
> asdf plugin-add ruby
> asdf install ruby latest
> asdf global ruby latest
```
