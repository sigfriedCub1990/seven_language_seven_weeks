# Find

- A few monad tutorials.
- A list of the monads in Haskell.

# Do

- Write a function that looks up a hash table value that uses the `Maybe` monda. Write a hash that store other hashes, several levels deep. Use the `Maybe` monad to retrieve an element for a hash key several levels deep.
- Represent a maze in Haskell. You'll need a `Maze` and a `Node` type, as well as a function to return a node given its coordinates. The node should have a list of exits to other nodes.
- Use a List monad to solved the maze.
- Implement a Monad in a nonfunctional language, like Ruby.
