# Do

- How many different ways can you find to write `allEven`?
  - [AllEven definitions](./AllEven.hs)
- Write a function that takes a list and returns the same list in reverse.
  - [Reverse](./Reverse.hs)
- Write a function that builds two-tuples with all possible combinations of two of the colors `black`, `white`, `blue`, `yellow` and `red`. Note that you should include only one of (black, blue) and (blue, black).
  - [Colors combinations](./Colors.hs)
- Write a list comprehension to build a childhood multiplication table. The table would be a list of three-tuples where the first two are integers from 1-12 and the third is the product of the first two.
  - [Multiplication table](./MultiplicationTable.hs)
- Solve the map-coloring problem using Haskell.
