# Find

- The implementation of some of the commonly used macros in the clojure language.
  - Use the `source` Luke ;), [When's implementation](./day_2/src/day_2/macros.clj)
- An example of defining your own lazy sequence.
- The current status of the `defrecord` and `protocol` features.
  - Book is a bit old, this is a stable feature of the language.

# Do

- Implemenent an `unless` with an else condition using macros.
- Write a type using `defrecord` that implements a protocol.
  - [Car example](./day_2/src/day_2/records_protocols.clj)
  - NOTE: I don't feel good about this but that's the best I can do with the (little) knowledge I have so far.
