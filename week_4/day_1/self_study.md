# Find

- The Scala API.
  I tried to be as close to the book as possible.
  [Scala API](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.12.17/)
- A comparison of Java and Scala.
- A discussion of `val` versus `var`.
  According to the Scala documentation recommends `val` over `var`, the difference between them is that the former declares an `immutable` variable (important for concurrency, for example), while the later declares a `mutable` variable.

# Do

- Write a game that will take a tic-tac-toe board with X, O, and blank characters and detect the winner or whether there is a tie or no winner yet. Use class were appropriate.
- Bonus problem: Let two players play tic-tac-toe.
